# Welcome to GSD - Get Stuff Done

**A basic task list application, using Vue.js, Node.js and Webpack**

### MVP Features (current)

- Add, edit and delete tasks
  - Click on task name to edit
  - x to delete task, regardless of status
- Toggle task status as active or completed
  - Check box on left to toggle status
- Filter tasks to show all tasks, active tasks or completed tasks.


### Nice-To-Have Features (planned)

- Individual TaskItem component to render a single task and the relevant data
- Router to make API calls to a database, in order to load a list of tasks
- Cool animations once I work out how!

## Command line statements to run the app

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# run the app at localhost:8080
npm run dev
```
